* Tasks
** TODO The "tip" of the repo may contain short-lived regressions. 
	We should find out the equivalent of the v8 'dev' channel in the other tools
** TODO Mateus, please make this doc to contain only installation instructions as to facilitate the work of students. -Marcelo            

* Engines
** v8: https://github.com/v8/v8/wiki/Building-from-Source
 - recommended branch: 6.5.254.31 (stable/beta used in chrome for linux/windows)
   - run "fetch --no-history v8" // to avoid downloading the entire repo
   - cd v8
   - git checkout 6.5.254.31 // to get this branch
   
   // @Mateus, If I just run git pull I get an error message "fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories". if I use "git pull --allow-unrelated-histories" I get lots of conflicts.
   - git pull 

   // @Mateus, at this point should we continue from "Building V8 TL;DR"?

   // @Mateus, are you suggesting we should modify something or pass some command-line option?
   - you don't need to get all the stuff in "install-build-deps.sh' to compile v8.

** spidermonkey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation
 - problem: if you just follow instruction you will certainly observe a build error. ‘PRLibSpec’ was not declared in this scope. (reason: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441454)
