TODO: The "tip" of the repo may contain short-lived regressions. We should find out
      the equivalent of the v8 'dev' channel in the other tools

TODO: Mateus, please make this doc to contain only installation instructions as to facilitate the work of students. -Marcelo

spidermonkey: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Build_Documentation
   problem: if you just follow instruction you will certainly observe a build error. ‘PRLibSpec’ was not declared in this scope. (reason: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441454)
   workaround: '../configure --enable-nspr-build'
